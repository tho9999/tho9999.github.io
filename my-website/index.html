                <p>I am a second year second degree computer science student at SFU. 
                    Prior to my second degree for computer science I got a bachelors of science in Kinesiology which took me 5 years to complete. 
                    Now I am interested in persuing a specialty in either Artificial intellegence or/and cybersecurity. With this course, I am hoping to 
                    get a good project to put on my resume and attempt to get a co-op next summer</p>

                <p>Growing up all my life I played hockey since the age of 4 and I haven't stopped since, now playing in a beer league. 
                    One of the things I like do in my free time is to play video games such as CS:GO, Valorant, and League of Legends.
                    Occasionally I like to go out and play golf with my friends but its a little expensive now. I like to try many sports and have 
                    gotten into racket sports such as pickelball and tennis. I also manage 2 fantasy hockey teams and when I can I also like to watch the Vancouver Canucks.

            <h2>Summer Travel</h2>
            <div class="info-paragraph">
                <p>This summer I took school off to travel. Right after finals I went with my family on a asia trip to Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong for my first time ever.
                    In Taiwan we went to the top of Taipei 101, went to the night markets, and the zoo which everything was so cheap compared to Vancouver. 
                    In Hong Kong we only went for a couple days as we were mainly there to visit family, however we went to the peak and saw a art exhibit.
                    We spent one day in Macau and saw all the casinos and the ruins of St. Pauls. After my asia trip later in the summer I went to LA and went
                    to Disneyland and Universal Studios.
